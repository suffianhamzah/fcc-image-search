Freecodecamp: Image Search Abstraction API
=========================

This is a microservice that provides two HTTP requests:
- GET /imagesearch/:search_term?offset={num}:
Pass a search term as a parameter and an optional offset query string. You will get a JSON response of link to images based on the search term.

- GET /latest/imagesearch:
This will return a list of the 10 most recent search queries requested.
